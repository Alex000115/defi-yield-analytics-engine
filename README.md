# DeFi Yield Analytics Engine

A high-quality Web3 reference project designed to demonstrate how decentralized
finance (DeFi) yield strategies can be analyzed, simulated, and explained across
EVM-compatible blockchains such as Ethereum, Base, Polygon, and Arbitrum.

This repository focuses on **liquidity pools, staking rewards, APR/APY logic,
and yield simulation patterns** using clean, readable, and beginner-friendly
blockchain intelligence code.

---

## Supported Networks
- Ethereum
- Base
- Polygon
- Arbitrum

---

## Project Goals
- Demonstrate how DeFi yield can be calculated
- Simulate liquidity pool rewards
- Explain APR and APY conversion logic
- Track protocol yield metrics
- Teach DeFi data flow using structured reference code

---

## Features
- Yield calculation engine
- Liquidity pool simulator
- Staking reward estimator
- APR to APY converter
- Network configuration handler
- Clean, modular reference code
- Beginner-friendly documentation

---

## Repository Structure
All files are located in the root directory for simplicity:

- `network.config.js` → Blockchain and RPC configuration
- `yield.calculator.js` → APR/APY calculation logic
- `pool.simulator.js` → Liquidity pool simulation
- `staking.rewards.js` → Staking reward estimation
- `protocol.metrics.js` → DeFi protocol analytics
- `address.utils.js` → Wallet validation helpers
- `rpc.client.js` → RPC connection handler
- `index.js` → Main reference entry file
- `yield.model.js` → Yield data structure
- `defi.simulator.js` → DeFi strategy simulation

---

## How It Works
1. Connects to a blockchain RPC endpoint
2. Reads protocol configuration
3. Simulates liquidity pool behavior
4. Calculates APR and APY metrics
5. Estimates staking rewards
6. Displays structured yield insights

---

## Configuration
Open `network.config.js` and update:
- `NETWORK` to select your blockchain
- `WALLET_ADDRESS` to analyze DeFi positions

---

## Use Cases
- Learning DeFi fundamentals
- Yield strategy research
- Protocol analytics dashboards
- Web3 developer onboarding
- On-chain financial modeling
